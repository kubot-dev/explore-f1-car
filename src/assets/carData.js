        'A diffuser in an F1 car is the rear part of the bodywork. The air flowing under the car exits through the diffuser as shown in the photo. This action by the diffuser is responsible to create lions share of downforce. An interesting thing about fluid moving at high speed is that the pressure will be low. So the job of the diffuser is to make the exiting air to be as fast as possible, hence reducing pressure. This pressure drop will consequently generate more downforce.',

        'F1 exhausts are carefully designed and constructed to enhance the performance of an F1 car. Theyre typically made from high-grade titanium or Inconel, a nickel-chromium alloy known for its heat resistance and durability. The exhaust system consists of a series of pipes that run from the engine to the cars rear, where the exhaust gases are expelled. The design of F1 exhausts plays a crucial role in the overall performance of an F1 car. The exhaust gases produced by the engine contain a significant amount of energy, and carefully directing these gases can boost the cars acceleration and speed. ',

      description:
        'This concept is based on Bernoulli’s principle and the Venturi effect. When air is forced through a funnel, it speeds up as the space decreases. It then creates less pressure underneath the car, which causes the air to circulate faster. This creates a large downforce which helps stick the car to the track and increases its speed. In short, lower pressure equals higher speed and vice versa. The idea of ground effects was to create a low-pressure area underneath the car.',

        'The rear wing of an F1 car is a crucial component of its aerodynamics. The primary function of the rear wing is to generate downforce, which presses the car onto the track, improving its grip and speed. The rear wing is positioned at the back of the car and creates a wake that flows over and around it, reducing the air resistance or drag. The rear wing is also adjustable, which allows the driver to optimize the cars stability and speed on different tracks.',

In addition to steering and shifting, an F1 driver will make a number of adjustments to the brake balance, fine-tuning the car to different corner characteristics.',
